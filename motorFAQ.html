    <h1>Which current data should I use?</h1>

            You may have noticed that MotoCalc reports two different current values: battery current and motor current.
            And choosing between them can leave you feeling a bit like this:<br> <br>
            <img src="https://www.vhv.rs/dpng/d/564-5648259_are-you-crazy-emoji-decal-hd-png-download.png" alt="crazy"></img><br> <br>

            It is frustrating when one value seems far more favorable than the other. However, it’s important to understand the trade-offs. 
            While battery current often predicts better endurance, it does not align closely with our wind-tunnel data. In fact, our testing 
            showed significant discrepancies. These discrepancies were large enough that many teams in my year had to nearly double their battery capacity to meet 
            endurance goals when relying solely on battery-current predictions.<br> <br>



            Because of this, I’ve chosen to present both values in this tool. This allows teams to see the optimistic estimate (battery current)
            alongside the more conservative, but often higher than reality, motor current, which tends to overestimate power draw. Providing both ensures 
            you can make informed decisions and design with the level of margin you feel is appropriate.<br> <br>

            Finally, remember that all the performance data originates from MotoCalc. This tool is simply
            meant to organize and present it in a clearer, more digestible format. It’s ultimately up to you,
            the user, to determine which values best support your design.<br> <br>
